# Impact Of Data Science And Policy

## Objectives

1. Objective 1
2. Objective 2.

## Instructions

Do a preliminary brainstorm about topics, domains, or industries that interest you. This may be a current (or upcoming) public or corporate policy issue where you believe the application of data science tools and methods could make a substantive difference in how debates and (perhaps) decisions around the issue play out. For this assignment, we will ask you to practice a “policy brief” style of communication, which attempts to change the status quo by explaining a weakness and provides guidance on what to do in a particular situation.

Find a recent (if possible) magazine, newspaper, or academic article relevant to the domain you choose. Try to pick one that discusses how data and/or analysis will (or could) fill an information gap and thereby make an impact for firms or organizations in that space. If the article is not about data science per se, infer what the data science obstacle and opportunity is. 

Start with the slide deck template and guide. Although the instructions are geared towards group presentations, the instructions should still provide useful information about the procedures and format for presenting in this class. Provide a bullet-point style brief of:

- (Slide 0) Always have a title slide! How will you pique our interest?
- (Slide 1) Where/when/why the article was written including the original authors’ 1) most important and 2) most problematic claims.
- (Slide 2) What the gap is to be filled by data science. Is it a data gap or an analysis gap, or both?
- (Slide 3) How the gap(s) might be filled.
- (Slide 4) Who would be motivated to 1) invest in the data science and/or 2) use the data science findings and why. You may list multiple stakeholders here.
- (Slide 5) What are the most important opportunities and obstacles to 1) acquiring the data and making it available and/or 2) analysing the data and communicating the findings.
- (Slide 6) Include a bibliography slide with full references and links (you may only have one) in any citation style. Do not include full references in your body slides.

You will deliver your slide deck as 6-7 minute in-class presentation. The time limit will be strictly enforced, so practicing to meet the time limit will definitely help. Remember that you will be receiving feedback from your classmates after the presentations, so edit your slides at least once to make sure both the slides and script are effective.
